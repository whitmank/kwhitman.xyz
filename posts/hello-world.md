Welcome to my blog! This is my first post.

## How this works

I write posts in markdown and drop them in the `posts/` directory. When I push to GitHub, the site automatically rebuilds.

## What I'm excited about

- Simple workflow
- No complex frameworks
- Just markdown and HTML

That's it. More posts coming soon.
