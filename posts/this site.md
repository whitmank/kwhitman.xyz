I used Claude Code to make this site in like half an hour.
It's a folder on my machine that syncs with a git repo, git pages for hosting.
Each post is a markdown file, which is built into static html whenever I publish changes (github actions).
It even wrote me a little shell script to do the build and push, all I gotta do is type ```publish``` in the site directory.

That’s pretty cool computing. So easy anyone can do it… if you pay the tax.
My strategy at this stage is to just let go of my desire to have everything beautiful and perfect, and just settle for purely functional. This lets me get stuff out the door, into the world, without my perfectionism getting in the way.

I’m not like… proud of the site or anything, with time, iteration and even some manual programming/design *(imagine using your own brain)*, it’ll get better. But really, I’ll be working on other stuff, the next thing, a more interactive sort of browser for my content. This is just a text dump. And I love it!
