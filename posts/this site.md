My strategy at this stage is to just let go of my desire to have everything beautiful and perfect, and just settle for purely functional. This let's me get stuff out the door, into the world, without my perfectionism getting in the way. Embracing imperfection. Quality is iterative. This is only first iteration.

Anyway:

I used Claude Code to make this site in like half an hour.
It's a folder on my machine that syncs with a git repo, git pages for hosting.
Each post is a markdown files, which are then built into static html whenever I publish changes (github actions).
It even wrote me a little shell script to do the build and push, all I gotta do is type ```publish``` in the site directory.

That’s pretty cool computing. So easy anyone can do it… if you pay the tax...
