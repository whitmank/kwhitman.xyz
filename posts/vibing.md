## What did I do today?
So I’m vibing together an app for file management. It’s really more of an index, not a file manager, as in it’s not manipulating files directly. It’s a virtual organization layer that stands over the native file system. It’s an index of objects that represent and point to a source URI, whether a file or url or what have you. It’s a database that catalogs your files across all devices, keeping the index in sync everywhere while preserving local files on disk. It’s not a cloud storage/sync system, it’s just a map of where all your files are, a unified map from disparate sources. This means that the app is one unified view for browsing and organizing your files, across all your devices. Even if the files on device are different, you’re always going to be looking at the same interface.

THIS is the tangible problem I’m trying to solve, basically… having to use Finder, iOS files, android Files, browsers for bookmarks, and {streaming-app} for music library, and {photo-app/kill-me} for photo library. Data, *personal data*, should not be siloed, or app specific. It should all be unified. Local first, everything is a file. Personal data sovereignty. Those are the goals.

Also, more fundamentally, I’m trying to get away from hierarchical file systems, into more rhizomatic structures, but that’s a post for another time.

Using the term “vibe-coding” seems too unserious at this point. I promise I'm not being overly self serious here, but I think it’s fair to say that a new paradigm of “programming” with language models is taking shape, and it’s no longer just “vibes”. That was the experimental phase, but now people are realizing what’s going on. People are talking about methods, frameworks, they’re taking it more seriously.

Also it’s strange to call what I’m doing “programming”, because I’m not really writing code. I’m basically doing project management, with a software dev in a black box.

So what am I doing? I’m not programming… in the classical sense. Neither am I “vibe-coding”. That *is* what I’m doing, but I think it’s more than that. I’m not just telling an agent to do something vague, hitting enter, and hoping for the best. I’m programming, but in English, not code. And it’s awesome. I was always a terrible coder. My language skills, foreign and coding, are pretty feeble. But my command of English is pretty strong, if I do say so myself. And now I can program in English.
It’s just what I always wanted really.

## What did I learn?

So I truly “vibed” together v0.1, super sketchy app with limited functionality. Then it took a little more effort to guide the model into creating a more robust system architecture. Data model, database, API, frontend, electron wrapper… not too complicated, still within my realm of understanding from my limited forays in the realm of web development. That was v2, felt like I was driving.

Now I’m working on 0.3.
Maybe it’s going back into vibe territory, because now the model is doing stuff for me that I really just scan and nod and vibe-check. I’m generating maybe overly elaborate development plans, in pursuit of more “robust” architecture, but I’m starting to suspect that keeping things simple is the way to more sustainable development. If something doesn’t work, at least I can use the model to fix it, and maintain a mental model of what’s going on under the hood. Front loading big dev road maps and sending the model to run through it all leaves me kind of just sitting here, hoping it turns out alright.

I don’t really feel the need to be “in control” or “self-sufficient” in terms of being able to maintain the software myself, I’m really not much of a programmer. I want my effort to be directed towards product design and user experience. But if I get so carried away directing the model from my arm-chair to do crazy shit that I don’t truly understand, it’ll probably get in the way of long-term maintainability.

I risk getting lost in the sauce, losing my grip on the project. I do not want that. I don’t mind accepting dependency for programming, but I cannot allow myself to outsource my own high-level understanding of the thing I’m building, then I’m truly vibing, not project managing or product owning or whatever I want to be able to claim I’m doing.
Version 0.3 I suspect is gonna be a bit… much, and I’ll probably resimplify things on the next pass.

I’m also vibing on a budget here, $20/month gang, so keeping things simple and doing one task at a time instead of huge multi-phase refactors is gonna help me stay in my ~3 hour session window. That’s an annoying limitation… but perhaps for now it’s a good creative limitation, training wheels, to keep me from getting ahead of myself.
